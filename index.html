		<h1> What is VAT ?</h1>

		<p>VAT stands for Value Added Tax. VAT is added to a product at every point on the supply chain where value is added. This method of taxation used by more than 160 countries around the world. Most of the countries that use VAT are located in the European Union.

		<h2>How is VAT Calculated ?</h2>


		<h3>Including VAT.</h3>

		<p>The math behind calculation a VAT inclusive price is rather simple. The basic formula is to multiply the net price by the VAT percentage i.e  VAT included price = (net price x (VAT percentage + 1)). For example if you have a good/service that cost $20 and the VAT percentage is 12% you would simply multiply 20 x 1.12 for a result of $22.20.</p>


		<h3>Excluding VAT.</h3>

		<p>Calculating a VAT exclusive price is a similar process. First multiply the VAT percentage by the net price. Then you subtract the result of that calculation from the original net price. Here is a formula VAT excluded price = (net price - ((VAT percentage/100) x net price)). For example we will use $20 again. First we will multiply the VAT percentage by the net price: <span><br></span>
			<span><br></span>
			20 x 0.12 = 2.40
			<span><br></span>
			<span><br></span>
			Now we take the and result subtract it from the original price, which will give us the VAT excluded price:
			<span><br></span>
			<span><br></span>
			20-2.40 = 17.60
			<span><br></span>
			<span><br></span>

			The good news is that I have developed this tool so that you do not have to worry about the math behind it.
